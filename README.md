# About and Goals: 
   After i finished my first year as IT tech student. 
   i tought about a "Psysical Defense" for Users based on mouse movements and cardinals, with no experience in ML, while data is being mined automatically from the OS.
   The main goal is to create a extra layer of defence for Organizations and private users, where the ML model would recognize the behavior of the user and would play considering the circumstances.
    
    
## What was done:
   - auto data-mining from two difference OS and adaptation in general to different screens.
   - Configure various ML models to the specific data and evaluation.
    
    
## What is left to do:
   - Sample more data.
   - Configure the Data and ML to get better evaluations.
   - Cloud and Etc(Not relevant to the Scope).
